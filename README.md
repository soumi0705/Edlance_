**The problem Edlαnce solves :** \
Field of Interest :\
EdTech: Help the field of education move from the dark ages to the golden age of technology.
Blockchain: Bring change to transactions and cryptocurrency with promising Blockchain solutions.

### Problem Statement:
* Education sector was one of the worst hit, due to lockdowns, 0 physical classes, reduced student-teacher interaction, and less to no Doubt Clearing sessions.
* A lot of Educators lost their employment. Taking classes all day through a Wi-Fi connection also takes a toll on their pockets.
* Gamification concept must be implemented for better learning and keeping students engaged.
* Students in these times also feel like to contribute to their pocket money themselves.


### Proposed System:
* A blockchain solution, connecting students to freelance educators whose livelihoods are impacted in the pandemic. 
* Application of a trending education technique "Education by Gamification" (Peer answering resulting in real monetary rewards).
* Bounty system in which each question will have some mEth put in as bounty and can be redeemed be giving an answer within a constrained time period.
* Peer answer should be verified by Expert before unlocking of funds for better user experience.
* Additional Disscussions Panel for Peer-Peer communication, sharing of knowledge.

### Benefits:
* Verified Educators can earn their livelihoods easily at the comfort of their house.
* Motivates students to excel even more in their field of interest. Helps even student earn in cryptocurrency and add to the pocket money
* With the bounty system we believe that much tougher questions can be asked through the portal and will attract many people to answer. 
* Urgency of getting a question solved, higher the need of answer higher the bounty you can keep.
* All procedures of payment and dispute resolution will follow the Law of Code set by our Edlance Smart Contract, making it completely transparent to public.


### Future Plans :
1. Upvote/downvote (for peer answers)
2. Auto upgrade account to Student Pro (calculation Based on their Peer answers)
3. Paid Discussion panel (with Experts)
4. Additional knowledge sharing section (off-Topic)\
